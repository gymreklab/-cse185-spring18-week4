# Week 4: Why don't snakes have legs? (Part 2)
Skills covered: Epigenomics, accessing public databases, multiple sequence alignment, motif analysis

## 6. Zooming in on ZRS

IGV zoom in on Shh and ZRS region
add phyloP conservation scores. get using the "table browser" at ucsc

interpret what those conservation scores mean

## X. ChIP-seq 
want to know more about if this region is an enhancer or not

look at k27ac data in the region
give alignments
call peaks with homer
load to IGV

## 7. Multiple sequence alignment of enhancer sequences

mafft for MSA
mafft --auto ../../public/week4/zrs_sequences_evgeny.fa > zrs_sequences_msa.fa
visualize with MVIEW https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mview/

## 8. Motif analysis 
FIMO on the mouse sequence
what motif corresponds to the missing region

## 9. For your lab report
